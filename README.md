# Live Image Captioning Using Convolutional Nueral Network and LSTM

This is an easy to use google colab notebook implemented using python and tensorflow. It will download the dataset and perform all the processing and training of the model.

Optimization Technique used is Adam Optimizer and loss function of cross entropy has been used here. Feel free to change them.

Architecture Followed is Merge architecture.
Dataset : Flicker8K Dataset

Feel free to play with it. Try changing the epoch and the CNN model.
